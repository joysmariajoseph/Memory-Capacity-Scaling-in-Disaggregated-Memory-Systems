# Memory-Capacity-Scaling-in-Disaggregated-Memory-Systems
Ongoing Master Thesis Project as part of M.Tech program at IIT Guwahati. Aim of the project is to develop an effective model with the help of hypervisors to scale the memory capacity in disaggregated memory systems. Main focus on reducing the memory latency incurred due to the state of the art architecture and technology constraints.
